# LEARN

Understand that the fundamentals of coding starts within the mind. If you don't believe you can, you can believe that you cannot code. If there is a passion within you to code and create, then chase that passion. Remove all distractions that cause you to stray away from that passion, and always, ALWAYS, keep God first. If God is for you, who can be against you?
